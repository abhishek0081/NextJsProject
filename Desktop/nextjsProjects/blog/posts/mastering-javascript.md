JavaScript powers the web - it's **the** most important programming language you need to know as a web developer.

For example, you should understand code like this:

```js
const basics = "Easiest code in Javascript!!";

const printBasics = (data) => {
  const allData = data.map((singleData) => singleData.name);
  return allData;
};
data = [
  { name: "Abhishek kumar", occupation: "Coder" },
  { name: "Robin raj", occupation: "student" },
];
const returnedData = printBasics(data);
console.log(...returnedData);
```
